#### Course Description
> Node and Express go hand in hand. The ability to use this programming paradigm on any kind of web or mobile application makes this skillset incredibly valuable.
> And the advantage of being able to build Full Stack applications based on just one language (JavaScript) is becoming more appealing every day. This is especially true for start-ups that put a big emphasis on being able to iterate early and often.
